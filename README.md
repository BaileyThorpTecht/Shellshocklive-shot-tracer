# TODO:
- [ ] Draw an arch or series of short lines or points
- [ ] Store power and angle variables and use them to draw  
- [ ] Make it redraw (and update vars) on key press  
    - [ ] May have to deal with window focus issues  
- [ ] Make the arch start at a chosen position (the tank)  
    - [ ] Make it either go to location clicked/dragged or do some color detection with another api (ambitious)  
  
- [ ] Do some in-game experimenting to accurately convert power and angle numbers to shot trajectories
- [ ] Eventually also add in wind
